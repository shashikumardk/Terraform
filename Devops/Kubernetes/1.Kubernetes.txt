why kubernetes?
Mainly kubernetes has autoscaling,distrubuting of traffic.

Kubernetes:
It is open source container management tool which automates container deployemnt, container (de)scaling and container load balancing.


Features of Kubernetes:
Autoscaling
Auto Healing
Load Balancing
Roll back Feature
Health Monitering for containers
Batch Execution




K8S over Docker SWARM:
GUI available
Inbuilt Looging and monitering
DATA volumes can be shared with POD

Docker SWARM over K8S:
Fast and easy
Not supports Autoscaling
Supports only Docker 
DATA volumes can be shared at container level 




K8S architecture:
UI/CLI >>>> API call >>>> K8S master >>>>> Nodes



Note:
Both Docker and Kubernetes are different where,
*Docker is containerization platform
*Kubernetes is container management platform
*It suppourt 5000 worker node per Cluster
*Kubernetes is Orchestration Tool(clustering of any number of containers running on different network)
*Docker id Containerazation Tool(which is used to create containers)`
*We create Mainfest file(.yml) to do any changes/apply any changes to cluster.
